# The Legend of Miesta

A heartfelt web application created to celebrate my long-time childhood friend's birthday, delivering random, whimsical quotes that capture his unique and quirky humor.

Built with a simple stack of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, this project is a small token of appreciation to bring a smile to his face and brighten anyone's day with every click.
